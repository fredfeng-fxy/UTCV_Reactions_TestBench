This folder contains the code for the Solution Temperature Sensor.
The code contains the following functions:
* Get the temperature data from the senser and print the temperature if the temperature change between two consecutive meassurements is greater than 0.2ºC

The sensor type is DS18B20 Waterproof Digital Temperature Sensor Kit, which can be bought with this link: https://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/ds18b20-waterproof-digital-temperature-sensor-kit.html
